# ReadMe


This is my configuration for NeoVim. It is supposed to be fast and easy to understand.
# TODO:
## Design and milestones:
### Readme file & organization of the repo (CLEAR CONFIG):
- [ ] Description of the configuration and installation
- [ ] better organization of the config

### Wished features:
- [ ] Debugging in python
- [ ] Investigate packer and load in an efficient way.
- [ ] Writing text/essays support.
- [ ] Notes integrated
- [ ] Make list of installed plugins
- [ ] maybe wttr.in in the lualine

## Clear steps in plugins:

### Lua:
- [ ] How does that M function works.
- [x] What does really on_attach do?

### To install 
- [ ] Dap
- [x] Dashboard
- [x] git signs
- [x] indent blank line
- [x] comments
- [x] hop
- [x] terraform
- [ ] Vimwiki??
- [ ] vim-easy-align?

### Improvements
- [ ] Whichkey: Better config.
- [X] cmp:to show all properties and not just text
- [ ] Lsp: real understanding of how it works
- [ ] Nvim-tree: toggle should open either on the current file or in the main folder.
- [ ] Nvim-tree: command :bd to buffer delete, doesnt work if the toggle is open. it closes everything.
- [ ] LSP Python really working.

## Neovim could do:
- [ ] Brackets and braces: I want to be able to colapse them and to move outside them better.
- [ ] Markers
