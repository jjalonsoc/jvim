- [ ] Make list of installed plugins
- [ ] maybe wttr.in in the lualine
- [ ] Pick errors, (not show all of them)
- [ ] Linting integrated

## Clear steps in plugins:

### Lua:

- [ ] Nvim-tree: command :bd to buffer delete, doesnt work if the toggle is open. it closes everything.
- [x] LSP Python really working.

## Neovim could do:
